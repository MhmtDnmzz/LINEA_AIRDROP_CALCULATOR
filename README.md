# Linea Allocation Checker

This script checks the LINEA token allocation for a list of wallet addresses based on a provided allocation file.

## Features

- Displays detailed allocation information (LXP, LAM, LINEA tokens) for each found address.
- Provides summary statistics, including the number of found addresses, total tokens, and total LXP for the found wallets.
- Case-insensitive address matching.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- `pandas` library

## Setup

1.  **Place your files in this directory:**
    - `linea_allocations.csv`: This file must contain the airdrop data, including the columns `address`, `lxp`, `lam`, and `linea_allocation`.
    - `addresses.txt`: This file should contain the list of wallet addresses you want to check, with one address per line.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in this directory and run the following command to install the required Python library:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python3 check_allocations.py
```

### Example Output

The script will print the results directly to your terminal. 

```
